Disscussion
*In the case of the third amount (50030), did the debit amount correspond to the expected amount? 
The  Amount is 50030, Charge from configuration file is 50 as it falls between 50001 - 999999999
The customer will pay 50030 - 50 = 	49980
a charge of 50 will be deducted from their account so they still ended up been debited 50030
